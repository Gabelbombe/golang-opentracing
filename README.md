# Example Opentracing App

## Building


Make sure that you have Go installed, then run `go build`. If you are missing
dependencies, run `go get ./...`. Alternatively, you can build the application
using docker by running `scripts/docker_build.sh`.

## Running
This is a trivial example app that demonstrates how OpenTracing can be
used with!

To run the program, run `./golang-opentracing`. This will, by default,
start a new Appdash server and write all of your traces to it. However,
if you want to use a different tracer system, i.e. LightStep, all you have
to do is pass the flag `--lightstep.token=ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### Docker
A prebuilt docker image already exists. Run
`docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 -p 8700 Gabelbombe/golang-opentracing`.
If you run the docker image, you might not be able to
access the various endpoints through localhost. If using docker machine.
`docker-machine ip MY_MACHINE` will give you the IP you should access the
addresses at, i.e. `123.45.67.123:8700/traces`.

## Todo
* Add a second process that's in a different language, i.e. python.
